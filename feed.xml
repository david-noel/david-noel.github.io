    &lt;p&gt;I’m thinking more and more that I need a new side project to work on.  The project needs to be something that I
personally need. I don’t care if no one else will find it useful.  A podcast app is most likely going to be that
project. I listen to podcasts on my daily commute and I am really getting tired of how poor the apps are.  I need
something better.  The app needs to be simple and useful while following current UX standards.  That means material
design.  It has been a while since I have written an Android application.  It will be interesting to see how things
have changed since I worked on mkRemote.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;What gives?  All the Android podcast apps are pretty bad.  They all seem buggy and look horrendous.  Back in the day
there was Google Listen but even it had issues.  Then came some apps that used Google Reader as a back end.
They were not great but they kind of worked.  Reader left the scene and everything left standing fails to meet my needs.
I’ve been using Podax for a while but it is really buggy.  I’m debating writing my own simple podcast player app.
Here are some of the features I will need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Support for a single Tiny Tiny RSS feed.  Additional feed management is performed by Tiny Tiny RSS.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Follow the Google style guidelines.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pre-fetch episodes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Restart playing an episode where I left off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
